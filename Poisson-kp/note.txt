this subfolder consists of various routines, most importantly: the Poisson-Schrodinger solver

the data-file
-band data are stored as vband is negative

unitary test:
-test_abs
-test_Vbare

Chuang's gain compute
-test_gain

Momentum vs dipole, 2013Gu_PRB
-test_dipole


PS note:
-fully coupled with kp
-the simple mixing scheme, very hard to converge at high density
-the broyden algrithm, fast convergence, note that we can adjust the fist appoximated inverse Jacobian "mesh.G".
-f_charge_evp compute the "exact" charge, in contrast to discussion below eq.(36),2009Scheibenzuber_PRB


discretization
-mesh.xc lies at the middle of each element, effectively a "control" variable of that volume.
-wavefunction and charge are defined nodally.
-other material parameters are defined elementwise.
-mesh.evb is defined elementwise, one reason is that we don't have a unique value of potential at heter-interface.
-phi solved from the PS-eq are nodal variable, then phi_xc is elementwise, and returned by solve_PS_Broyden.
-mesh.piechar = -[0 diff(mesh.Pol) 0]';because mesh.Pol is element-wise, while mesh.piechar(charge sheet) has to be nodal.



1.do not use ovp-check unless necessary, needs very dense k grids to validate this procedure
2.keep load_params and assem_kp consistent, e.g. mesh.gap-> bowing factor
3.plot_convergence to confirm everything's fine, e.g. relative position of targets fermilevel, regularity of E(k)
  if necessary, plot each subband to check SB1 SB2.

Case In_{0.25}GaN
  -for both single and MQW cases, use unrelax<=0.2 for esheet>=1e14
  -for single well
     -unrelax=0.5 upto esheet=5e13
     -unrelax=0.2 upto esheet=1e14      
  -for MQW, 
     -unrelax also <=0.3.for esheet=2e13, 0.2 for 1e14, 0.1 for 1e14
     -note the range for fminbnd is critical when sheet charge density is low, use larger range
     -note the target for eigs is also critical when sheet charge density is low
3.for MQW, number of eigen-values, Nwell*Ncb, Nwell*Nvb, when esheet>=1e14, Ncb>=12,Nvb>=16;
