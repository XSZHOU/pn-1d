# pn-1d
I created this simple drift-diffusion code during my graduate study, 
since such source code is extreamly unavailable on the internet,
possibly because the TCAD market is heavily dominated by the few vendors.

The finite element method(FEM) and finite volume method(FVM) are employed in the implementation

# bpm-2d is a 2d BPM code

# possion-kp is a Poisson-Schr√∂dinger solver
