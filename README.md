I created these simple matlab code during my graduate study, 
open sourced here, since such source code is extreamly unavailable on the internet.

# pn-1d is a 1D hybrid FEM and finite volume method(FVM) drift-diffusion solver 

# bpm-2d is a 2D BPM code for integrated photonics

# Possion-kp is a Poisson-Schr√∂dinger solver for low-dimensional system
